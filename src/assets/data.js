  aboutBrief: `Nike, Inc. is an American multinational corporation that is engaged
  in the design, development, manufacturing, and worldwide marketing
  and sales of footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and
  services. The company is headquartered near Beaverton, Oregon, in
  the Portland metropolitan area.`,
  history: `Nike, originally known as Blue Ribbon Sports (BRS), was founded
  by University of Oregon track athlete Phil Knight and his coach,
  Bill Bowerman, on January 25, 1964. The company initially
  operated in Eugene, Oregon as a distributor for Japanese shoe
  maker Onitsuka Tiger, making most sales at track meets out of
  Knight's automobile. According to Otis Davis, a University of
  Oregon student athlete coached by Bowerman and Olympic gold
  medalist at the 1960 Summer Olympics, his coach made the first
  pair of Nike shoes for him, contradicting a claim that they were
  made for Phil Knight. According to Davis, "I told Tom Brokaw
  that I was the first. I don't care what all the billionaires
  say. Bill Bowerman made the first pair of shoes for me. People
  don't believe me. In fact, I didn't like the way they felt on my
  feet. There was no support and they were too tight.`,
